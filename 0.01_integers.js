1; //example of a whole integer
1.1; //example of a decimal
//double is a variable that can have a decimal and have a + or - sign, where an integar cannot use decimal

console.log(1);//should dsiplay 1 and 1.1 on the bottom. Now we run some operations with these numbers
console.log(1.1);

console.log(1+1);//Add 1 with 1
console.log(1*1);//Its 1 times 1
console.log(1.1*1.1);//You can even multiply decimals and you will get a decimal answer. If you use a decimal in anyway, you will get a decimal for your answer.

//basic operators (+,-,*,/)
console.log(5+5); //addition
console.log(6-6); //subtraction
console.log(7*7); //multiplication
console.log(8/8); //division

//mod operator is the % symbol. This is really handy down the road.
console.log(10 % 5); //ten mod 5 is the remander after you divide 10 by 5, which is 0 in this case.
console.log(10 % 4); //ten mod 4 shoudld get you 2 as 10/4 leaves us with 10-8, which is 2.

console.log(7+7.1);
